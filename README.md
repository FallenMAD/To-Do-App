# Technologies used:
  - HTML
  - Sass (SCSS)
  - BEM
  - React
  - TypeScript

# Feature Overview
  In this project, I use **BEM** and reuse some blocks to avoid code duplications. I used semantic tags for good structure of page.

  Also styles are implemented using **Sass(SCSS)** and advanced features like mixins, functions, variables and etc.

  I used custom **fetchClient** for fetch data from server.

# For what?
  The main goal of this project is a practice with fetch api and understand how it work with React.To understand how React works and how create reusable components.
  Also it's a practice with TypeScript, I used different types, interfaces, enums.
